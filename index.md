# AROS Porting Team

## Introduction

The purpose of this team is to keep information auf ports to AROS in a single place.

The usual procedure is to fork a repository and transfer ownership to the AROS Porting Team. The branch ```main``` is used for upstream. Branches like ```upstream-v1.2``` are linked to a certain tag. If not available a date is used. Branches like ```aros-patch-v1.2``` keep the required commits for the AROS port. When done a release is made with a name like ```v1.2-aros.1```. The last number is a version number which will be increased when a port needs fixes.
